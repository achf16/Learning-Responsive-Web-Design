                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work
                    under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some
                    key terms about the language.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="What_is_CSS_for">
                <header><h2>What is CSS for</h2></header>
                <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size
                    of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of
                    text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be
                    used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific
                    examples.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="CSS_syntax">
                <header><h2>CSS syntax</h2></header>
                <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be
                    applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
                </p>
                <p>For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text.
                    The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>

                <!--TODO: give a background color to #212121-->
                <div class="code_back">
                    <code>
                        <span class="purple">h1</span> {
                        <span class="rose">color</span>: red;
                        <span class="rose">font-size</span>: 5em;
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector.</li>
                    <li>This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case, we are styling level
                        one headings (h1).</li>
                    <li>We then have a set of curly braces { }.</li>
                    <li>Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value
                        pairs. We specify the property (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify
                        the value of the property after the colon (red in this example).</li>
                    <li>This example contains two declarations, one for color and the other for font-size. Each pair
                        specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that
                        we'd like to give the property.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>

                <div class="code_back">
                    <code>
                        <span class="purple">h1</span> {
                        <span class="rose">color</span>: red;
                        <span class="rose">font-size</span>: 5em;
                        }

                        <span class="purple">p</span> {
                        <span class="rose">color</span>: black;
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The
                    individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when
                    you forget or when you want to know what else you can use as a value.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="CSS_modules">
                <header><h2>CSS modules</h2></header>
                <p>
                    As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into
                    modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation pages
                    are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference
                    to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is and the properties and
                    features it contains. In that module, you will also find a link to Specifications that defines the
                    technology (also see the section below).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this stage, you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured; however, it can make
                    it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to
                    be found among other similar things, and is therefore, probably in the same specification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that
                    it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this
                    module. And you'd be right.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="CSS_specifications">
                <header><h2>CSS specifications</h2></header>
                <p>All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called
                    specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C,
                    WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.</p>

                <p>CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This
                    group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS.
                    There are other people, known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; they are not
                    linked to a member organization.</p>

                <p>New CSS features are developed or specified by the CSS Working Group — sometimes because a particular
                    browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and developers
                    are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a
                    requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features becoming available. However, a key
                    thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break
                    old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable
                    in a browser today!</p>

                <p>As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended
                    for engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to
                    read to understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much rather refer to MDN documentation or
                    other tutorials. Nevertheless, it is worth knowing that these specs exist and understanding the
                    relationship between the CSS you are using, the browser support (see below), and the specs.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="External_stylesheet">
                <header> <h2>External stylesheet</h2></header>
                <p>An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most
                    common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple
                    web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we
                    linked an external stylesheet to our web page.
                </p>

                <p> You reference an external CSS stylesheet from an HTML &lt;link&gt; element:</p>
                <div class="code_back">
                    <code>
                        &lt;!doctype html&gt;

                        &lt;/<span class="green">html</span>&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>The CSS stylesheet file might look like this:</p>
                <div class="code_back">
                    <code>
                        <span class="purple">h1</span> {
                        <span class="rose">color</span>: blue;
                        <span class="rose">background-color</span>: yellow;
                        <span class="rose">border</span>: 1px solid black;
                        }

                        <span class="purple">p</span> {
                        <span class="rose">color</span>: red;

                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>The href attribute of the &lt;link&gt; element needs to reference a file on your file system. In the
                    example above, the CSS file is in the same folder as the HTML document, but you could place it
                    somewhere else and adjust the path. Here are three examples:
                </p>

                <div class="code_back">

                <p>In some circumstances, internal stylesheets can be useful. For example, perhaps you're working with
                    a content management system where you are blocked from modifying external CSS files.</p>

                <p>But for sites with more than one page, an internal stylesheet becomes a less efficient way of
                    working. To apply uniform CSS styling to multiple pages using internal stylesheets, you must have
                    an internal stylesheet in every web page that will use the styling. The efficiency penalty carries
                    over to site maintenance too. With CSS in internal stylesheets, there is the risk that even one
                    simple styling change may require edits to multiple web pages.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Inline_styles">
                <header><h2>Inline styles</h2></header>
                <p>Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style
                    attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document might look like this:</p>
                <div class="code_back">
                    <code>
                        &lt;!doctype html&gt;
                        &lt;<span class="green">html</span> <span class="rose">lang</span>="<span class="green">en-GB</span>"&gt;
                            &lt;<span class="green">head</span>&gt;
                                &lt;<span class="green">meta</span> <span class="rose">charset</span>="<span class="green">utf-8</span>" /&gt;
                                &lt;<span class="green">title</span>&gt;My CSS experiment&lt;/<span class="green">title</span>&gt;
                            &lt;/<span class="green">head</span>&gt;
                            &lt;<span class="green">body</span>&gt;
                                &lt;<span class="green">h1</span> <span class="rose">style</span>="<span class="rose">color</span>: <span class="green">blue</span>;<span class="rose">background-color</span>: <span class="green">yellow</span>;<span class="rose">border</span>: <span class="green">1px solid black</span>;"&gt;
                                    Hello World!
                                &lt;/<span class="green">h1</span>&gt;
                                &lt;<span class="green">p</span> <span class="rose">style</span>="<span class="rose">color</span>:<span class="green">red</span>;"&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/<span class="green">p</span>&gt;
                            &lt;/<span class="green">body</span>&gt;
                        &lt;/<span class="green">html</span>&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible. It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the
                    least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple
                    edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML
                    and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content
                    makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.</p>
                <p>There are a few circumstances where inline styles are more common. You might have to resort to
                    using inline styles if your working environment is very restrictive. For example, perhaps your CMS
                    only allows you to edit the HTML body. You may also see a lot of inline styles in HTML email to
                    achieve compatibility with as many email clients as possible.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="About_the_DOM">
                <header><h2>About the DOM</h2></header>
                <p>A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language
                    becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM
                    nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.</p>
                <p>Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your
                    CSS and the document's content meet up. When you start working with browser DevTools you will be
                    navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see which rules apply.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="What_is_a_pseudo_class">
                <header><h2>What is a pseudo-class</h2></header>
                <p>A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the
                    first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer. They tend to act
                    as if you had applied a class to some part of your document, often helping you cut down on excess
                    classes in your markup, and giving you more flexible, maintainable code.</p>
                <p>Pseudo-classes are keywords that start with a colon. For example, <span class="makeup"> : hover</span> is a pseudo-class.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="User_action_pseudo_classes">
                <header><h2>User action pseudo classes</h2></header>
                <p>Some pseudo-classes only apply when the user interacts with the document in some way. These
                    user-action pseudo-classes, sometimes referred to as dynamic pseudo-classes, act as if a class had
                    been added to the element when the user interacts with it. Examples include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="makeup"> : hover</span> — mentioned above; this only applies if the user moves their pointer over an element, typically a link.</li>
                    <li><span class="makeup"> : focus</span> — only applies if the user focuses the element by clicking or using keyboard controls.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="What_is_a_pseudo_element">
                <header><h2>What is a pseudo element</h2></header>
                <p>Pseudo-elements behave in a similar way. However, they act as if you had added a whole new HTML
                    element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.
                </p>
                <p>Pseudo-elements start with a double colon <span class="makeup"> : :</span>.
                    ( <span class="makeup"> :: before</span> is an example of a pseudo-element.)</p>

                <p>For example, if you wanted to select the first line of a paragraph you could wrap it in a &lt;span&gt;
                    element and use an element selector; however, that would fail if the number of words you had
                    wrapped were longer or shorter than the parent element's width. As we tend not to know how many
                    words will fit on a line — as that will change if the screen width or font-size changes — it is
                    impossible to robustly do this by adding HTML.
                </p>
                <p>The <span class="makeup"> : : first-line</span> pseudo-element selector will do this for you reliably — if the number of words
                    increases or decreases it will still only select the first line.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Generating_content_with">
                <header><h2>Generating content with</h2></header>
                <p>There are a couple of special pseudo-elements, which are used along with the content property to
                    insert content into your document using CSS.</p>
                <p>You could use these to insert a string of text, such as in the live example below. Try changing the
                    text value of the content property and see it change in the output. You could also change the
                    <span class="makeup">::before</span> pseudo-element to <span class="makeup">::after</span> and see the text inserted at the end of the element instead of
                    the beginning.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Descendant_combinator">
                <header><h2>Descendant combinator</h2></header>
                <p>The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space (" ") character — combines two
                    selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor
                    (parent, parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc.) element matching the first selector.
                    Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.</p>
                <div class="code_back"><code>body article p</code></div>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Child_combinator">
                <header><h2>Child combinator</h2></header>
                <p>The child combinator (>) is placed between two CSS selectors. It matches only those elements
                    matched by the second selector that are the direct children of elements matched by the first.
                    Descendant elements further down the hierarchy don't match. For example, to select only &lt;p&gt;
                    elements that are direct children of &lt;article&gt; elements:</p>
                <div class="code_back"><code>article > p</code></div>
            </section>
