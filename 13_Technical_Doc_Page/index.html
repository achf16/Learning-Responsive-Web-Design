                <h2>What is CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work
                    under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some
                    key terms about the language.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="What_is_CSS_for">
                <h2>What is CSS for?</h2>
                <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size
                    of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of
                    text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be
                    used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific
                    examples.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="CSS_syntax">
                <h2>CSS syntax</h2>
                <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be
                    applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
                </p>
                <p>For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text.
                    The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>

                <!--TODO: make the code look alike real code-->
                <!--TODO: give a background color to #212121-->
                <code>
                    <span class="purple">h1</span> {
                    <span class="rose">color</span>: red;
                    <span class="rose">font-size</span>: 5em;
                    }
                </code>

                <ul>
                    <li>In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector.</li>
                    <li>This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case, we are styling level
                        one headings (h1).</li>
                    <li>We then have a set of curly braces { }.</li>
                    <li>Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value
                        pairs. We specify the property (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify
                        the value of the property after the colon (red in this example).</li>
                    <li>This example contains two declarations, one for color and the other for font-size. Each pair
                        specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that
                        we'd like to give the property.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>

                <code>
                    <span class="purple">h1</span> {
                    <span class="rose">color</span>: red;
                    <span class="rose">font-size</span>: 5em;
                    }

                    <span class="purple">p</span> {
                    <span class="rose">color</span>: black;
                    }
                </code>

                <p>You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The
                    individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when
                    you forget or when you want to know what else you can use as a value.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="CSS_modules">
                <h2>CSS modules</h2>
                <p>
                    As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into
                    modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation pages
                    are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference
                    to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is and the properties and
                    features it contains. In that module, you will also find a link to Specifications that defines the
                    technology (also see the section below).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this stage, you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured; however, it can make
                    it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to
                    be found among other similar things, and is therefore, probably in the same specification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that
                    it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this
                    module. And you'd be right.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="CSS_specifications">
                <h2>CSS specifications</h2>
                <p>All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called
                    specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C,
                    WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.</p>

                <p>CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This
                    group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS.
                    There are other people, known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; they are not
                    linked to a member organization.</p>

                <p>New CSS features are developed or specified by the CSS Working Group — sometimes because a particular
                    browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and developers
                    are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a
                    requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features becoming available. However, a key
                    thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break
                    old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable
                    in a browser today!</p>

                <p>As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended
                    for engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to
                    read to understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much rather refer to MDN documentation or
                    other tutorials. Nevertheless, it is worth knowing that these specs exist and understanding the
                    relationship between the CSS you are using, the browser support (see below), and the specs.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="External stylesheet">
                <h2>External stylesheet</h2>
                <p>An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most
                    common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple
                    web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we
                    linked an external stylesheet to our web page.
                </p>

                <p> You reference an external CSS stylesheet from an HTML &lt;link&gt; element:</p>
                <code>
                    &lt;!doctype html&gt;
                    &lt;<span class="green">html</span> <span class="rose">lang</span>="<span class="green">en-GB</span>"&gt;
                    &lt;<span class="green">head</span>&gt;
                        &lt;<span class="green">meta</span> <span class="rose">charset</span>="<span class="green">utf-8</span>" /&gt;
                        &lt;<span class="green">title</span>&gt;My CSS experiment&lt;/<span class="green">title</span>&gt;
                        &lt;<span class="green">link</span> <span class="rose">rel</span>="<span class="green">stylesheet</span>" <span class="rose">href</span>="<span class="green">styles.css</span>"/&gt;
                    &lt;/<span class="green">head</span>&gt;
                    &lt;<span class="green">body</span>&gt;
                    &lt;<span class="green">h1</span>&gt;Hello World!&lt;/<span class="green">h1</span>&gt;
                    &lt;<span class="green">p</span>&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/<span class="green">p</span>&gt;
                    &lt;/<span class="green">body</span>&gt;
                    &lt;/<span class="green">html</span>&gt;
                </code>

                <p>The CSS stylesheet file might look like this:</p>

                <code>
                    <span class="purple">h1</span> {
                    <span class="rose">color</span>: blue;
                    <span class="rose">background-color</span>: yellow;
                    <span class="rose">border</span>: 1px solid black;
                    }

                    <span class="purple">p</span> {
                    <span class="rose">color</span>: red;
                    }
                </code>

                <p>The href attribute of the &lt;link&gt; element needs to reference a file on your file system. In the
                    example above, the CSS file is in the same folder as the HTML document, but you could place it
                    somewhere else and adjust the path. Here are three examples:
                </p>

                <code>
                    &lt;!-- Inside a subdirectory called styles inside the current directory --&gt;
                    &lt;<span class="green">link</span> <span class="rose">rel</span>="<span class="green">stylesheet</span>" <span class="rose">href</span>="<span class="green">styles/style.css</span>" /&gt;

                    &lt;!-- Inside a subdirectory called general, which is in a subdirectory called styles, inside the current directory --&gt;
                    &lt;<span class="green">link</span> <span class="rose">rel</span>="<span class="green">stylesheet</span>" <span class="rose">href</span>="<span class="green">styles/general/style.css</span>" /&gt;

                    &lt;!-- Go up one directory level, then inside a subdirectory called styles --&gt;
                    &lt;<span class="green">link</span> <span class="rose">rel</span>="<span class="green">stylesheet</span>" <span class="rose">href</span>="<span class="green">../styles/style.css</span>" /&gt;

                <h2>Internal stylesheet</h2>
                <p>An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place

                <p>The HTML for an internal stylesheet might look like this:</p>
