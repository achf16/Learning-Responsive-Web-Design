<!-- There are two important definitions to understand when you try to build a responsive and scalable webpage
-    1. Root element: The root element is the element that contains all other elements. It's the <html> element.
-    2. Parent element: The parent element is the element that contains other elements. Some examples of parent elements
        are <body> and <div>, but they can also be other elements like <header> and <footer>.
-   Those terms are associated with rem and em in CSS:
    1.  em: A relative unit based on the font size of the parent element.
    2.  rem: A relative unit based on the font size of the root element (<html>).
-   Use Cases:
    1.  em: Useful for scaling elements in a relative context, such as adjusting the padding or margin relative to the
            font size of the parent element.
    2.  rem: Useful for maintaining consistency across the document, like setting a base size for typography and spacing
            that scales uniformly.-->
<!--
Other important thing to look after is give a name to every submittable from thing, besides, without it, the data from
that element won't be included in the submission, making it difficult to process the form data on the server.
The name attribute is crucial because it allows the browser to send the elementâ€™s data as part of the form submission,
with the name as the key and the input value as the value.

        Setting the same name attribute value for two different radio inputs ensures that only one of them can be
        selected at a time. This creates a group of mutually exclusive options, where selecting one radio button
        automatically deselects any other in the group. The browser enforces this rule because the name attribute
        groups the radio buttons together, meaning only one option within that group can be active at a time.

          <a> (Anchor Element):
              Used to create hyperlinks.
              Can link to other pages, sections within a page, email addresses, or files.
              Commonly includes href attribute for the URL, and the link text is visible to users.

          <link>:
              Used for linking external resources like stylesheets, icons, and preloading scripts.
              Placed inside the <head> section.
              It does not produce visible content on the page.

        In summary, <a> is for navigation, while <link> is for resource linking.
