<!-- There are two important definitions to understand when you try to build a responsive and scalable webpage
-    1. Root element: The root element is the element that contains all other elements. It's the <html> element.
-    2. Parent element: The parent element is the element that contains other elements. Some examples of parent elements
        are <body> and <div>, but they can also be other elements like <header> and <footer>.
-   Those terms are associated with rem and em in CSS:
    1.  em: A relative unit based on the font size of the parent element.
    2.  rem: A relative unit based on the font size of the root element (<html>).
-   Use Cases:
    1.  em: Useful for scaling elements in a relative context, such as adjusting the padding or margin relative to the
            font size of the parent element.
    2.  rem: Useful for maintaining consistency across the document, like setting a base size for typography and spacing
            that scales uniformly.-->

<!--        When you add an <input> element with type="submit" inside a form, it automatically creates a submit button that
        sends the form data to the server. This input element triggers the form submission when clicked.
        To handle the form submission, you place this submit button (the <input> with type="submit") after your last
        <fieldset> element. The value attribute of this input defines the text displayed on the button (e.g., "Submit", "Send"). -->
