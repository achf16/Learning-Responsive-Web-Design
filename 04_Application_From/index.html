<!-- There are two important definitions to understand when you try to build a responsive and scalable webpage
-    1. Root element: The root element is the element that contains all other elements. It's the <html> element.
-    2. Parent element: The parent element is the element that contains other elements. Some examples of parent elements
        are <body> and <div>, but they can also be other elements like <header> and <footer>.
-   Those terms are associated with rem and em in CSS:
    1.  em: A relative unit based on the font size of the parent element.
    2.  rem: A relative unit based on the font size of the root element (<html>).
-   Use Cases:
    1.  em: Useful for scaling elements in a relative context, such as adjusting the padding or margin relative to the
            font size of the parent element.
    2.  rem: Useful for maintaining consistency across the document, like setting a base size for typography and spacing
            that scales uniformly.-->

        Setting the same name attribute value for two different radio inputs ensures that only one of them can be
        selected at a time. This creates a group of mutually exclusive options, where selecting one radio button
        automatically deselects any other in the group. The browser enforces this rule because the name attribute
        groups the radio buttons together, meaning only one option within that group can be active at a time.

<!--        When you add an <input> element with type="submit" inside a form, it automatically creates a submit button that
        sends the form data to the server. This input element triggers the form submission when clicked.
        To handle the form submission, you place this submit button (the <input> with type="submit") after your last
        <fieldset> element. The value attribute of this input defines the text displayed on the button (e.g., "Submit", "Send"). -->
