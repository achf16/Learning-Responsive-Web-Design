        <!-- Knowleges:
            - always the code body should be inside of the <html><b0dy>CodeBody</b0dy></html> 
            - There're 6 types of headingd, organized by priority from h1 to h6
            - the basic header syntaxies is: <openingTag>content</openingTag>, where openingTag is one of h1-h6 
        -->
        <!--Good programming practices: Only use one h1 per page and place lower 
                                        importance headings below higher important headings-->
