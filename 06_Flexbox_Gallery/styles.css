/*  Important Knowledge:
The box-sizing property in CSS determines how the width and height of an element are calculated. There are two main values:
    - content-box (default): The width and height properties only include the content. Padding, borders, and margins
                             are added outside these dimensions.
    - border-box: The width and height properties include the content, padding, and borders. This makes it easier to
                  size elements consistently, as you donâ€™t need to add extra width for padding or borders.
