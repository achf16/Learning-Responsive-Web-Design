/*TO KNOW
@       CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values.
        For example:
                img { width: max(250px, 25vw); }
        In the above example, the width of the image will be 250px if the viewport width is less than 1000 pixels.
        If the viewport width is greater than 1000 pixels, the width of the image will be 25vw. This is because 25vw is
        equal to 25% of the viewport width.

@       The child combinator selector (>) in CSS targets only direct children of a specified parent element. This means
        it selects elements that are immediate descendants of another element, and not those nested deeper inside other
        elements.
